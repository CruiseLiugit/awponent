Most of React Native UI related components is scattered over the github, hackernews, FB groups, reddit. Here we try to create a portal for everyone to easily browse and experience the components. In the app we can search for a specific component or browse 
for the featured or new components. We can also like a component so that we can check it later on the favourite tab.

# Contributing

If you have React Native component, please help us adding the list. You can open PR and edit the `components.json` file.
Please note the following:

- `repo` is required
- `displayPicture` should be an image or gif under 200KB
